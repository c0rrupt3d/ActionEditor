# ActionEditor 

This project was created as an assignment [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## About

The project was created using ReactJS among many other libraries.

DraftJS was used to create the TextArea and to manage the EditorStates (undo/redo).

Persistance storage is enabled. The data can be stored locally to prevent data loss on page close.

The TextArea data can also be uploaded/downloaded from a Firebase server.

A Translate button was added to the UI but the functionality in unavailable due the lack of Google Translate API key.
(I will attempt to add this in the future once the Translate API servers let me create an API key) 


## Steps to view project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode after downloading necessary libraries (viewable in project.json).
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
